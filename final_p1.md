# My Working Project title
Rising Global Temperature and Increasing Carbon Dioxide Emission: is there a link?  

# Project owner
Muza Furin-Carraux 

## A high-level introduction and the goal of the project
I am interested in the global warming problem and it effect on humans. Studies show the correlation between rising levels of carbon dioxide and rising global temperature.  
The goal of the project is to portray how global temperature changes over time (recorded from 1885 to 2020) across continents and what role carbon dioxide plays in rising temperatures.

## Target Audience
Anyone who is looking for information about rising global temperature. 

## Story Arc
I hope my story will be persuasive, and increase empathy, understanding, and recall. 

## Setup
Global temperatures are on the rise. It has been consistently rising at a faster rate in the past 20 years!
I plan to show two charts: a scatter plot that demonstrates the change of temperature from 1880 to 2020 and a graph that shows faster growth of temperature in the past 20 years. 

## Conflict 
Human-produced activities contribute significantly to this problem. In fact, carbon dioxide emission is mostly responsible for rising global temperature (See Reference: “Warming due to carbon dioxide jumped by half in 25 years”). 
The chart with a trend line portrays how the human-produced carbon dioxide rises from 1980 to 2018. 

## Problem
We continue contributing to the problem by eating more meat, using fossil fuels, and nonrenewable energy etc.  

## Resolution
We can all contribute to reducing carbon dioxide. “Huge!”

## Anticipated Call to Action 
### For individuals
We can all do at least three things:
-	Power home with renewable energy and/or drive fuel-efficient vehicles. 
-	Reduce water waste because it takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, and treat your water. 
-	Actually eat the food we buy, because it takes a lot of energy to produce food, especially meat. 
- And many others! 

### For the government
- Protect and restore ecosystems (trees capture CO2).  
- Support agricultural producers because the meat production is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions.  
- Promote green energy

# User research protocol.
I reached to my colleagues from advancement analytics and prospect management teams at CMU and my old friend from 3M. All people who I interviewed have an experience working with data and visualization tools: they work in Tableau, Einstein analytics or other tools. 
My hope is to find out through their feedback if my visualization is clear, informative, and data-driven as well as to get their suggestions how to improve it. 
The target audience is pretty much anyone who cares about global rising temperature and would like to make a positive impact by slowing down its anomaly. 
However, the more targeted audience would be policy makers, government officials, scientists, students, teachers, and professors. 

## My interview script: 
1.	What do you think this storyboard shows?  
2.	Did you see this type of information before?
3.	What population group might be interested to know about it?
4.	What do you think the purpose of this wireframe?
5.	What did you find confusing? 
6.	What would you change?

### User interviews
### Feedback from three people who commented on my wireframes: 

| Question       | C. (Prospect management team) | N. (Analytics team) | E. (3M) | P. (3M) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What do you think this storyboard shows?       | “Temperature and carbon dioxide changes since 1980 and heat map of countries”   | “I think this storyboard describes global warming and demonstrates a relationship between rising levels of carbon dioxide and rising temperatures or the increased occurrence of anomalously high temperatures across the globe”. | “It shows correlation between global temperature and CO2 level” | “The storyboard shows that since the 1880s, the average global temperature has increased, and that since 1980 this correlates with the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It also shows changes more hot spots in global anomalies on the world map between 2000 and 2020.” |
| Did you see this type of information before?       | “No, never” | “Yes, I have seen this type of information presented before”.  | “Yes, of course”  | “Yes, I have seen similar information before.” |
| What population group might be interested to know about it?       | “People who live in countries that have seen the effects of the global rise in temperatures”  | “Any human who hopes our species can continue to live on Earth should find this information interesting. Good information on the causes and magnitudes of climate change would also be interesting to scientists, policy makers, political leaders, business leaders and anyone with a role to play in mitigating societal effects and limiting the causes of this important problem” | “It is very simple graph. I would think general population might be interested”   | “Population group that might be interested: the general public? Or maybe pupils in schools?” |
| What do you think the purpose of this wireframe?       |  “To show the increase in temperature over time” | “To plan for the creation of a visually impactful and easily comprehendible demonstration of the acceleration of the climate change problem”. | “To show that the temperature has been increasing over time and can be linked of high levels of CO2. The graph does not say that it could be human related” 	“Maybe the purpose of the wireframe is to prototype a visual aid for a textbook or some sort of social media?”  | “Maybe the purpose of the wireframe is to prototype a visual aid for a textbook or some sort of social media?”  |
| What did you find confusing? | “The maps.  Are they showing the same thing or are they measuring something like crop output changes, or amount of rain, weather…that part was unclear”. | “I did not find this storyboard confusing. I thought it was a clear outline of the information to be conveyed in a finished product”  | “The map is confusing. It brings pretty anecdotal evidences, and shows no trend” | “The first graph is temperature from 1885 to present. The second graph is global temperatures and carbon dioxide since 1980. Different time scale, and unsure of the link between graphs. And then the maps on the right show current on top, before on the bottom” |
| What would you change?       | “Maybe the map showing another variable, or some kind of question answered…” | “I might consider moving the maps to be side by side with 2000 on the left and 2020 on the right. Maybe not. This might ultimately be fun as a single map with a slider to change the visual depiction of the temperature anomalies over time!”
  | “I would remove the map because it does not bring any value. I would focus on CO2 trend: why it is increasing and could causality being shown but not correlation”.   | “I might have reversed that. Also, what are we trying to say about carbon dioxide? Just a correlation, or has causality been established though published and peer-reviewed scientific research? I would bring more evidence and graphs on that matter” |


# Findings from the interviews 
Based on the feedback that I received from my colleagues and a friend, the storyboard has a clear message and they were able to identify the target audience is everyone in the world (because this topic does concern everybody). 
Everybody did clearly understand the purpose of the wireframe and two of the interviewees saw this type of information before. 
Two people found maps confusing and not helping to relay the message. 
As for suggestions, people recommended to explore other subtopics to answer questions. One person recommended to explore CO2 trend and work on the correlation between rising temperature and CO2 level, and possibly show the causality.   

# My plan to use the feedback
1.	Clarification on correlation between CO2 emission and rising global temperature 
  -	Add more facts to support the idea about correlation between rising temperature and CO2 emission. 
  -	Incorporate the chart with CO2 emission
2.	Remove maps because they are confusing. 

## My preview on my initial revised project based on the feedback
Whatever I have reworked so far is preliminary. I will add more for the Part 2 and the presentation itself.

# Short description of how I'll be completing the final project.
I am going to use Flourish to create my visualization charts. The datasets that I found (below is the link, under Documentation of data sources), I will make a scatter plot to show the change of temperature from 1880 to 2020 and the human-produced carbon dioxide from 1980 to 2018. 
In order to tell the story of rising temperature around the globe from 1880 to 2020 and its possible contribution to the higher level of CO2, I will be using Shorthand. I have not explored the tool yet, but it looks like it has a good potential to tell a nice digital story.
