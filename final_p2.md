## Part II
### Design and user research (Part I)
Sketches and storyboards, a moodboard, user research protocol and findings, revised design / wireframes based off of user research and a summary of findings

### Final data story

Intended audience for your final data story.  Include any personas and / or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

My original target audiences were people who were mostly interested in global warming effect, such as scientists, government officials, professors and teachers, students and pupils. After I reached out to my colleagues and friends, I reconsidered my audience. They suggested me to broaden the audience and include almost everyone, because rising temperature actually affects everyone.

### An introduction and outline

It was not straightforward me to come up with the theme. Even though there are plenty of pictures on global warming and carbon dioxide emissions, it was hard to find the best pictures to deliver the succinct message. Finally I looked at a few articles whose contents I liked and decided to use their pictures. 

### Drawing wireframe with crayons/pens

I really appreciate this exercise. The fact that I spent some time drawing a few pictures with my son’s crayons and pens actually made me think thoroughly through the process holistically. I was planning to include fact sheets, first graph, second graph and mood boards to better tell the story.  
### Getting Feedback from others

This actually helped me see critically maps that I initially designed. I truly believed that they would help tell the story, but people found them quite confusing and not meaningful. Even though I am not a great artist, I liked my sketches of maps. 
Based on the feedback however I had to remove them from my revised work. People’s feedback helped me focus on what is central to my story and what needs to be added in order to make story more complete. 

### My story in Shorthand

Based on my revised wireframe, I made my visualizations. I planned to use flourish to make my graphs and then shorthand to create a story. Even though I knew how to use Tableau, I decided to use Flourish for two reasons: I already have knowledge of Tableau (I worked with a tool for two years) and wanted to explore teh new tool and Flourish is just easier. 

After I created my graphs in flourish, I was ready to implement my story in Shorthand. While working on chapters in Shorthand, I realized that I had to insert 
-	a few fact cards about rising global temperature and carbon dioxide emissions as I planned in my revised wireframes. 
-	a few pictures during transitions from one subtopic to another to make the visualization smoother.
- different background pictures to help the reader navigate through the story to visually absorb the main idea before the reader start reading the text and looks the graph. 

### Links 
•	Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. 

•	Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet on Canvas.  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.
