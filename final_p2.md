### Final data story

Intended audience for your final data story.  Include any personas and / or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

My original target audiences were people who were mostly interested in global warming effect, such as scientists, government officials, professors and teachers, students and pupils. After I reached out to my colleagues and friends, I reconsidered my audience. They suggested me to broaden the audience and include almost everyone, because rising temperature actually affects everyone.
