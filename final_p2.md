## Part II: The final deliverable

### The project introduction and outline, a project structure that outlines the major elements of my story can be found in [Part I](final_p1.md)
### Sketches (storyboards, a moodboard) and revised design/wireframes based on feedback of my colleagues and friends can be found in [Part I](final_p1.md)
### User research protocol and findings as well as summary of findings and  explanation of how I plan on using my data can be found in [Part I](final_p1.md)


### Final data story

### The audience

My original target audiences were people who were mostly interested in global warming effect, such as scientists, government officials, professors and teachers, students and pupils. 

After I reached out to my colleagues and friends, I reconsidered my audience. They suggested me to broaden the audience and include almost everyone, because rising temperature actually affects everyone.

### The project introduction and outline

I regularly read American Scientific journal. I noticed a lot of topics related to global warming. Lots of discussion related to global warming and emission of CO2 really pushed my interest in researching this topic.

Personally, I feel the effects of global warming. I remember that years ago there was always winter in Pittsburgh. In the recent years, summers have become hotter and winters have become warmer. 

I wanted to investigate this topic and use it for my digital story. I was wondering if I could find enough data on this topic which would be publicly accessible. To my surprise, I found a few websites with data. I am excited to present it. 

### Drawing wireframe with crayons/pens

I really appreciate this exercise. The fact that I spent some time drawing a few pictures with my son’s crayons and pens actually made me think thoroughly through the process holistically. I was planning to include fact sheets, first graph, second graph and mood boards to better tell the story.  

### Getting Feedback from others

This actually helped me see critically maps that I initially designed. I truly believed that they would help tell the story, but people found them quite confusing and not meaningful. Even though I am not a great artist, I liked my sketches of maps. 

Based on the feedback however I had to remove them from my revised work. People’s feedback helped me focus on what is central to my story and what needs to be added in order to make story more complete. 

### My story in Shorthand

Based on my revised wireframe, I made my visualizations. I planned to use flourish to make my graphs and then shorthand to create a story. Even though I knew how to use Tableau, I decided to use Flourish for two reasons: I already have knowledge of Tableau (I worked with a tool for two years) and wanted to explore the new tool and Flourish is just easier. 

After I created my graphs in flourish, I was ready to implement my story in Shorthand. While working on chapters in Shorthand, I realized that I had to insert 
-	a few fact cards about rising global temperature and carbon dioxide emissions as I planned in my revised wireframes. 
-	a few background pictures during transitions from one subtopic to another to make the visualization smoother.
- different background pictures to help the reader navigate through the story to visually absorb the main idea before the reader start reading the text and looks the graph. 

I have also included CO2 emissions chart by country for informative purposes.
