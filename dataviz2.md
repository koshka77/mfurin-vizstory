#  Different methods of visualization

The first chart shows government debt by country in one year (2019), the second chart shows government debt by years and countries. I used grid of line charts to display trend line of countriesâ€™ government debt. It shows how the debt changes from 1995 to 2019. 

For my third visualization I used pie charts to show the relative government debt for each country: one pie chart per year. I decided to group countries together and display each year to show how government debts change from year to year.  Visually, a person can tell that 2019 is the smallest pie chart out of all years, meaning that governments have less debts than in previous years.
