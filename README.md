My full name is Muza Furin-Carraux.

# About me: 
I am an employee at CMU. I have been working for CMU for a few years in Advancement Analytics team. 
Our team builds reports and dashboards using different tools, including Einstein Analytics, for different departments of the division. 
I am also a part-time student at CMU (MPM program). This is my third and last year with the program. My plan is to graduate in December 2020.

# Classes I take this semester
I am taking Telling Stories with Data class.

# What I hope to learn:
I have been exposed to different tools that help visualize data. I have used Tableau, Einstein Analytics and Crystal Reports, and I do recognize that all these tools are good with some pros and cons. However, the more I use different tools, the more I realize how important it is to find the most optimal and sometimes even simple way to inform the audience. I hope to learn in this class technique and tricks how to leverage whatever tool we have available in order to make data speak.
