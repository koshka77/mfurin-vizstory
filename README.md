My full name is [Muza Furin-Carraux](www.linkedin.com/in/muza-furin-carraux-phd-3182a89).

# About me: 
I am an employee at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/). I have been working for CMU for a few years in Advancement Analytics team. 
Our team builds reports and dashboards using different tools, including Einstein Analytics, for different departments of the division. 
I am also a part-time student at CMU (MPM program). This is my third and last year with the program. My plan is to graduate in December 2020.

# Classes I take this semester
I am taking Telling Stories with Data class.

# What I hope to learn:
I have been exposed to different tools that help visualize data. I have used [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Einstein Analytics](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein-analytics/overview/) and [Crystal Reports](https://www.crystalreports.com/), and I do recognize that all these tools are good with some pros and cons. However, the more I use different tools, the more I realize how important it is to find the most optimal and sometimes even simple way to inform the audience. I hope to learn in this class technique and tricks how to leverage whatever tool we have available in order to make data speak.
